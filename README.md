# Generative AI Projects

## Project Goals
This repository is dedicated to exploring Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Projects will include text generation, chatbots, and other creative AI applications.

## Skills Demonstrated
- GPT-based text generation
- OpenAI API or Hugging Face LLM
- Building simple chatbots
- Fine-tuning generative models

## Structure
- `/notebooks` - Experiments with LLMs
- `/src` - Python scripts
- `/results` - Sample outputs

## Future Work
- Enhance chatbots with multi-turn conversations
- Combine NLP models with generative AI
